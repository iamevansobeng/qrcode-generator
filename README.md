## Project Purpose

This project was initiated to address the issue of misleading QR code generation services that claim to be free but later impose charges by redirecting the generated QR codes. This practice is essentially deceptive, and this project aims to provide a genuinely free and reliable QR code generation tool.

## Features

- Instant QR code generation.
- Customizable QR code options (size, color, error correction level).
- Downloadable QR codes as image files.
- No hidden fees or redirects.
